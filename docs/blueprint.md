# **App Name**: AgentVerse

## Core Features:

- Goal Definition: Initial goal setting: Allows the user to input a high-level objective or task for the AI agent to accomplish. The AI then will use a tool to formulate a comprehensive plan, breaking down the objective into smaller, actionable steps.
- Automated Task Execution: Task execution: The AI agent automatically executes the steps defined in the plan, leveraging various tools such as web browsing, data analysis, and code execution, as needed.
- Progress Tracking: Real-time monitoring dashboard: Provides a user interface to monitor the agent's progress, showing the current task, completed steps, and any encountered issues or errors.
- Feedback Integration: Iterative refinement loop: Display and allow users to review the AI agent's completed tasks and provide feedback to refine the approach for subsequent executions. Allow them to suggest different tools or techniques that can lead to better results.
- Customization UI: A user interface where the user can customize the persona and other capabilities of the agent.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Slate blue (#737CA1) to evoke a sense of intellect and sophistication, crucial for an AI-driven app.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F2F5) for a clean and unobtrusive backdrop, emphasizing the content and interactive elements.
- Accent color: Electric purple (#8661C1) as an accent to draw attention to key interactive elements and CTAs.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look; well-suited to both headlines and body text.
- Minimalist, geometric icons that represent different AI agent capabilities and actions.
- Clean, card-based layouts to present individual tasks and progress updates in an organized manner.
- Subtle transitions and loading animations to provide feedback during AI task execution.
