## Getting Started: Your 3-Minute Launch

You're just a few commands away from having your own AI agent up and running. We've streamlined everything to make it as simple as possible.

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Run the App:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
3.  **Start the AI Engine (in a new terminal):**
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:watch
    ```

That's it! Your AgentVerse application is now running locally on port `9002`.

## What's Next? Explore Your Agent's Universe

You've successfully launched AgentVerse. Now the fun begins. Hereâ€™s a roadmap to get you acquainted with your new AI-powered creation:

1.  **Start a Conversation:** Open your browser to `http://localhost:9002` and start a new chat. Get a feel for the default agent's personality.
2.  **Generate Code:** Ask your agent to create a UI component. For example: *"Create a login form with a password visibility toggle."* Then, open the generated code in the **Sandbox** to see it come to life instantly.
3.  **Customize Your Agent:** Navigate to the **Settings** page. This is where you take control. Give your agent a new name, a unique role (like "Sarcastic Code Reviewer"), and custom instructions. Go back to the chat and see how its personality has transformed.
4.  **Dive into the Code:**
    *   `src/app/chat/[conversationId]/page.tsx`: This is the heart of the chat interface. See how it handles user and assistant messages.
    *   `src/ai/flows/chat.ts`: Explore the Genkit flow that powers the agent's decision-making and responses.
    *   `src/components/ui/`: Check out the beautiful, reusable ShadCN components that make up the UI.
